! Determine north-south extents for messages exchanged in the eastern
! and western directions: this leads to two variants of code, depending
! which exchange method is used.  In the case of 8-message exchange the
! corners are sent/received directly by special small messages, so
! extents are computed exactly the same way as east-west extents above.
! Conversely, the 4-message exchane is a two-stage procedure. At first,
! the messages sent/received to/from northern and southern neighbours
! are unpacked first and the data is placed into the respective ghost
! rows.  Once this is complete, messages going into eastern and western
! directions are packed in such a way that the corner points withing
! the computational margins of already filled are included into the
! eastern and western bound exchanges.  This eliminates the need for
! special corner messages and makes the north-south extents slightly
! larger than in the case of 8-message approach.
