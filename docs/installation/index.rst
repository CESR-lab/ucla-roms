Installing ROMS
===============
To install ROMS, a number of dependencies are required. Different methods for obtaining these dependencies are detailed on the :doc:`dependencies <dependencies>` page.
With the necessary dependencies installed, instructions for obtaining and compiling ROMS can be found on :doc:`this page<compilation>`. It is then possible to compile and run an example simulation, described :doc:`here. <running_example>`
