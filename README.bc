This file contains set of remarks about boundary conditions:

Remark 1:

  PERIODICITY RULES: in the case of periodicity conditions in either
  directions, all fields have the same number of points regardless of
  their type according to the staggered grid convention, (RHO-, U-,
  V- and PSI-types). The internal ranges of indices are 

         1:Lm in XI-direction
         1:Mm in ETA-direction

  Two rows of ghost zones are set for each field in this case, so
  that:

         A(-1,j,..)=A(Lm-1,j,..)     A(i,-1,..)=A(i,Mm-1,..)
         A( 0,j,..)=A(Lm  ,j,..)     A(i, 0,..)=A(i,Mm  ,..) 
         A(Lm+1,j,..)=A( 1,j,..)     A(i,Mm+1,..)=A(i, 1,..)
         A(Lm+2,j,..)=A( 2,j,..)     A(i,Mm+2,..)=A(i, 2,..)

  Periodic boundary conditions are extracted from the bcs routines
  (which perform physical boundary conditions) and are done by the
  generic routines exchange_XXX_tile, where XXX ={r2d,u2d,v2d,p2d,
  r3d,u3d,v3d,p3d,w3d} is the type of the array according to the
  staggered grid convention.

  From now on the periodicity conditions are NO LONGER considered
  as boundary conditions, but as exchange of ghost points between
  different subdomains and different processors. Conversely, all
  places in the code where periodicity rules are applied are
  logically consistent with the places of ghost zone exchanges as
  it would be in a message passing code.



Remark 2:

  NOTICE ABOUT PARALLELIZATION STRATEGY: Because of their nonlocal
  nature, periodic boundary conditions must be applied first, if the
  the boundary conditions are applied just _after_ a synchronization
  point. In this case the periodic boundary [ghost, or target] points
  are set by the thread working on subdomain to which these [ghost]
  points belong. This is the IMPLOSION strategy.

  Conversly, periodic boundaries must be applied last, if the
  boundary conditions are applied just _before_ the synchronization
  point. In this case the periodic boundary [ghost] points must be
  set by the thread working on the subdomain which has the internal
  [source] points from which the [ghost, or target] points are
  receiving their values. This is the RADIATION strategy.

  The present version of the code employs the RADIATION strategy.



Remark 3:

  ORDER OF APPLICATION  of physical boundary conditions: In the case
  of U- and V-type variables the boundaries normal to the direction
  of propagation are set; after that the boundary tangential to the
  direction of propagation is set:

     U-type                         V-type
       first                          first
         Western edge                   Southern edge   
         Eastern edge                   Northern edge
       then                           then
         Southern edge                  Western edge
         Northern edge                  Eastern edge

  This is done to avoid necessity of special care about the corner 
  ghost points in the case of combinations of open and solid
  boudaries. 

Remark 4:

  RADIATION mode used in these routine is derived from Raymond and
  Kuo (1984: A radiation boundary condition for multi-dimensional
  flows, Quart. J. R. Met. Soc., 110, pp 535-551). The outgoing
  phase speed is projected in each horizontal coordinate direction
  at the open boundary. As opposed to Orlanski (1976), this greatly
  reduces the sentivity on the spatial derivative normally displayed
  in the phase speed calculations. The present conditions differ
  from Raymond-Kuo by using upstream scheme for spatial derivatives
  and implicit phase speed to increase numerical stability.

  Explicit and implicit versions of radiation boundary conditions
  are being developed.
