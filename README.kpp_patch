Summary of changes in KPP:

"mixing.h" a new global array "swr_frac" is introduced; See it at
           the very end, next to ghat.

"main.F", initialization part:  introduced a call to new subroutine
          lmd_swr_frac just after 3D grid is generated for the very
          first time (note that here z_r, z_w, and Hz correspond to
          ZERO-FREE surface state at this moment).  Subroutine
          "lmd_swr_frac" computes light attenuation fraction and
          puts it into a global 3D array "swr_frac". The state of
          this array remains constant during the entire run time. 

          This constancy may be reconsidered in future, especially
          for the case of biological modeling, where light
          attenuation depends on concentration of Phyto, etc, but at
          the present state there is no point to recompute "swr_frac" 
          at every time step, because all what is done here is to
          use globally fixed Jerlov water type bi-exponential 
          attenuation model.


"lmd_swr_frac.F"  newly introduced routine (supersedes lmd_swfrac.F,
          which is now obsolete.

          Note that unlike the older version, "swr_frac" is computed
          by attenuation of light point-by-point, so that in
          principle attenuation coefficients may be space dependent.
          (currently they are Jerlov-water-type constants).


"lmd_kpp.F" significantly rewritten; incompatible with previous
            versions because of different array structure and
            associated internal calls.

          However, the number of arguments of "lmd_kpp_tile" is
          exactly the same as before and there is no need to modify
          its driver, which is "lmd_vmix.F".


"lmd_wscale_ws_only.h"     these two include files supersede
"lmd_wscale_wm_and_ws.h"   subroutine "lmd_wscale.F", which is
                           now obsolete.


"step3d_t3S.F" modified code within LMD_KPP CPP logic; basically 
               to make it compatible with new lmd_kpp. It uses
               new array "swr_frac" for light attenuation and it
               also have different algorithm for nonlocal flux.

          Note that meaning of array "ghat" is now changed: it is
          no longer flux, but just a non-dimensional shape function
          of nonlocal flux for a tracer.  Consequently, as of right
          now

          non_local_flux_for_tracer(itrc,k) =
                   = ghat(k) * surface_forcing_flux(itrc)

          so that ghat is now the same for all tracers.


          Depending on previous versions of "step3d_t3S.F", there
          may be visual changes in the vertical tri-diagonal solver
          code associated with vertical diffusion step. These
          changes are purely code optimizations mathematically
          equivalent to the previous codes.

         
Obsolete routines: "lmd_wscale.F", "lmd_swfrac.F" these two are
no longer used for anything.

Modifications to Makefile: (Makefile is not included in this patch)

          1) exclude lmd_wscale.F and lmd_swfrac.F from source list.
          2) add lmd_swr_frac.F
          3) execute "make depend" so that dependency list is
             updated and is aware of "lmd_wscale_ws_only.h" and
             "lmd_wscale_wm_and_ws.h".
