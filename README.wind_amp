This is patch tarfile to include reading of wind stress amplitude
from file. 

Usage of this file:

   There are total of 5 files involved in code modification:
   4 of them can be (and recommended to be so) safely overwritten;
   the fifth file, "lmd_kpp.F", should be examined and it is safer
   to patch it rather than (e.g., my CPP setting may be different
   than yours; but the only place which needs to be modified is
   computation of "ustar": 


# ifdef WIND_STRESS_AMP
          ustar(i,j)=sqrt(amptau(i,j))
# else
          ustar(i,j)=sqrt(0.5*sqrt( (sustr(i,j)+sustr(i+1,j))**2
     &                             +(svstr(i,j)+svstr(i,j+1))**2))
# endif


Description of changes:
----------------------

forces.h    added extra variables to handle wind-stress amplitude.
 
get_smflux.F        added interpolation of wind-stress amplitude;
                    also improved netCDF error diagnostics, but
                    other than that everything is identical to what
                    it was before;

get_stress_magn.F   new file --> this file should be added to 
                         SRC list of Makefile.

get_forces.F        added call to get_stress_magn just after call
                    to get_smflux.


lmd_kpp.F    change in "ustar"  as stated above.


NOTES:
-----

1. The whole procedure is activated by CPP switch WIND_STRESS_AMP

2. Wind-stress magnitude is expected to be in one of the forcing
   files (not necessarily the same as wind-stress components) and
   is expected to have name netCDF variable name 'atau', which,
   however, can be changed as parameter setting in
   "get_stress_magn.F".

   The code is designed to handle without and adjustment the
   following situations:

         a. If 'atau' is placed into the same netCDF file as wind
            stress components, it may share timing variable
            'sms_time' with them, or may have its own time variable
            called 'atau_time' or whatever name_time, if its name
            is changed from 'atau' (ROMS convention is to name
            timing variables using the same name in suffix '_time'
            attached at the end for scalars).

         b. If 'atau' is placed into a different netCDF file, it
            must be supplied with timing variable.  Again, the
            time variable is must be named either as 'atau_time'
            or 'sms_time'.

         c. Of the two possibilities, 'atau_time' or 'sms_time',
            the first one takes precedence; the second it used
            only if the first does not exist.

         d. 'atau_time' may or may not have netCDF attribute
            'cycle_length'.  It is treated accordingly.

         e. Theoretically it is possible to have independent timings
            for sustr,svstr and atau (including situations where
            they are defined at different times of frequencies),
            while all of them are placed into the same netCDF file.
