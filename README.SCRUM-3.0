S-Coordinate Rutgers University Model (SCRUM), Version 3.0:

This ocean model solves the free surface, hydrostatic, primitive
equations  over  variable  topography  using  stretched terrain-
following coordinates in the vertical and orthogonal curvilinear
coordinates in the horizontal.
Earlier versions of SCRUM are described in:

Song, Y. and D. Haidvogel, 1994: A semi-implicit ocean circulation
      model using a generalized topography-following coordinate
      system, J.  Comp.  Physics, 115, 228-244.

The model equations are solved separately for total momentum and
and  vertically integrated momentum and then coupled.  The total
momentum and tracer equations are time discretized using a third
order Adams-Bashforth scheme;  the vertical  viscosity/diffusion
term is treated  implicitly using a  Crank-Nicolson scheme.  The
free surface  and  vertically integrated  momentum equations are
time discretized using a trapezoidal Leapfrog scheme. Horizontal
and  vertical derivatives are evaluated using finite differences
on a staggered horizontal C-grid and a staggered vertical grid.

This new version is based on  Dr. Yuhe Song  earlier version and
the modifications carried out by Dr. Robert Chant which included
vertical  finite  differences on a  staggered  vertical grid and
Smolarkiewicz horizontal and vertical advection scheme.  Some of
advanced features of  SPEM 5.1  were adapted like rotated mixing
tensors  and  Lagrangian  drifters.  This version was completely
re-structured and documented by Dr. Hernan G. Arango.

New Features:

  * Vertical staggered grid.
  * Vertical finite elements are replaced by finite differences.
  * Option for Horizontal and vertical Smolarkiewicz advection.
  * Rotated mixing tensors to mix  on constant  z-surfaces  and
    constant "in situ" density surfaces.
 * Several vertical closures:
     (1) Pacanowski and Philander (1981) mixing scheme.
     (2) Mellor and Yamada (1974) level 2 closure.
     (3) Mellor and Yamada (1982) level 2.5 closure.
     (4) Large, McWilliams, and Doney (1994) oceanic planetary
         boundary layer and ocean interior mixing scheme.
  * Keen and Glenn (1994) coupled bottom boundary layer model.
  * Lagrangian drifters.
  * Analytical and data driven packages for initial conditions,
    boundary conditions, and forcing functions.
  * Analytical test examples.
  * Input/output via netCDF.
