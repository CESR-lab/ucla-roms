! User notes:
!   1) Specify tracer variable details here. 
!      (number of tracers (NT) still set in param.h for now)
!
!   2) tracer name in netcdf file for _bry.nc and _init.nc
!   must have same name as trace variable. E.g. ptrace1 -> ptrace1
!   However, in the surface flux forcing file, the name of the
!   variable must be appended with _flx. E.g. ptrace1 -> ptrace1_flx
!
!   3) Make sure tracer surface flux units are correct!

! USER INPUT 1:
! - Interpolate forcing from coarser input grid (=1) or not (=0)
      interp_t = 0 ! Factor 2 scaling only for now
! - now complete USER INPUT 2 below.


! MARBL USERS NOTE:
!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!      if running with MARBL, do not specify BGC tracers in this file: they are
!      provided to ROMS by MARBL. Control the MARBL config (therefore tracers)
!      using a "marbl_in" file in your run directory. 
!      Regarding output: by default, all MARBL tracers are written to output file.
!      To control which particular tracers to write out, make a
!      text file "marbl_tracer_output_list" in your run directory
!      and add the shortname of each required tracer to a new line.
!      If the text file is empty, does not exist,
!      contains only comments (!) or no recognised tracers,
!      ROMS will revert to default behaviour and output all MARBL tracers.
!      Output frequency etc. are still controlled using "bgc.opt".
!      For a list of available MARBL tracers, see
!      $MARBL_ROOT/tests/regression_tests/requested_tracers/requested_tracers.py 


! USER INPUT 2:
!
! descriptions:
!
! wrt_t     = True/False whether to write tracer to output file
! wrt_t_avg = True/False whether to write tracer avg to output file
! t_vname   = Tracer short name
! t_units   = Tracer units (for outputing tracer)
! t_lname   = Tracer long name (for outputing tracer)
! t_tname   = Name of time dimension that goes with tracer in forcing file.
!             Not necessary for analytical model or no surface forcing for tracer.
! t_ana_frc = Whether surf flux is read in (0), or analytical (1)
!             Could be extended 2,3,... depending on different types of
!             analytical forcing, e.g. time variant/invariant, and further
!             specific for each variable using its 'itrace' index...
! itot      = Counter to increment tracer indices without hard-coding indices,
!             thus each new tracer index (e.g. itrcX) simply needs:
!             itot=itot+1, then itot can populate arrays in correct position;
! wrt_t_dia = Only with DIAGNOSTICS flag. Don't need otherwise.
!             True/False to output tracer diagnostics.
!
! nt_passive= Number of passive tracers (default=0). Set here is you have them.

      wrt_t     (itemp)=.True.;    wrt_t_avg(itemp) =.True.    ! temp
