! Canonical log-layer drag law formula valid for Zob << Hz only.   It
! should NEVER be used as it may cause instability in extremely shallow
! areas due to the singularity as Zob approaches Hz  (e.g., Yusuke PV4
! configuration in the extreme low-tide phase).

c**           rd(i,j)=rdrg + cff*(vonKar/log(Hz(i,j,1)/Zob))**2

! The following formula comes from the finite-volume interpretation of
! log-layer in the bottom-most grid box derived WITHOUT using Zob << Hz
! assumption. It covers the entire range of from Zob << Hz to Zob >> Hz
! and correctly asymptotes to the viscous limit in the latter extreme.
! The next formula after it is a simplified version which nevertheless
! yields correct asymptotic limits in both extremes, safely passing
! through Zob=Hz transition, and closely matching the upper formula
! there: setting Zob=Hz makes [vonKar/(2*ln 2-1)]^2 = [vonKar/0.386]^2
! upper vs. [vonKar/ln(3/2)]^2 = [vonKar/0.405]^2 lower.
