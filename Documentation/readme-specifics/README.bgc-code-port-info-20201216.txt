bgc: porting info from ETH bec2 functionality into roms code. 20201216.

Usage:

	Outputting of bgc tracers is controlled by wrt_t (or wrt_t_avg for averages) in tracers_defs.h.
	Outputting of bgc BEC2_DIAG terms is controlled by wrtavg_bec2_diag_2d & wrtavg_bec2_diag_3d
	(for both his and avg) in init_scalars_bec2() in bgc.F.

Large memory:
 
	Since BGC can have an vast number of 3D variables, it drastically increases the memory demand
	on roms. If roms fails to link at the end of compilation (likely with 'relocation truncated to fit' 
	error message), the 2GB static allocation has been exceeded. To fix this, activate the LARGE_MEM_FLAG 
	in Makedefs.inc to -mcmodel=medium or -mcmodel=large, and then do a clean compile of roms.


Name changes only for clarity/grouping of bgc code:

	ecosys_bec2.h -> bgc_ecosys_bec2.h
	bio_diag.h -> bgc_bio_diag.h
	tracers.h ->  bgc_tracers.h (though indxPO4, etc is not used anymore by new code for tracer netcdf 
	output, it has been included in order to get ETH port to compile only)
	def_his.F -> def_his_bgc_diag() in bgc.F
		      -> def_avg_bgc_diag() in bgc.F
	def_rst.F -> def_rst_bgc_diag() in bgc.F    
	wrt_his.F -> wrt_his_bgc_diag() in bgc.F
	wrt_avg.F -> wrt_avg_bgc_diag() in bgc.F
	set_avg.F -> set_avg_bgc_diag() in bgc.F
	ecosys_bec2.F -> bgc_ecosys_bec2.F
	ecosys_bec2_init.F -> bgc_ecosys_bec2_init.F
	init_scalars_bec2.F -> init_scalars_bec2() in bgc.F      

Code moved to different files:

	iPO4, iNH4, etc in param.h now moved to tracers.F module through include files tracers_defs_idx.h 
	and tracers_defs.h.

bgc functions:

	subroutine init_scalars_bec2():
	    - In bgc.F module.
		- Called from init_scalars.F.
		- Sets up metadata for bgc variables.
		- Sets T/F for output variables of BEC2_DIAG.
		
	subroutine ecosys2_init():
		- In bgc_ecosys_bec2_init.F.
		- Called from main.F.
		- Sets up bgc coefficients.
		
	subroutine ecosys_bec2_tile(istr,iend,jstr,jend):
		- In bgc_ecosys_bec2.F.
		- Called from step3d_t_ISO.F.
		- This is where all the bgc computations are performed.
		
	I/O:
		- These routines are now in bgc.F module.
		
bgc variables:

	bgc tracers -> 't'               -> tracers.F          (module for ROMS physics on tracers)
				-> 'tracers'	     -> bgc_ecosys_bec2.h  (variable containing tracers for bgc computations)
	
				't' is copied into 'tracers' for bgc computations at start of ecosys_bec2_tile, 
				then updated 'tracers' is copied back into 't' at end of ecosys_bec2_tile).
	
	diag vars	-> 'bec2_diag_2d/3d' -> bgc_ecosys_bec2.h	

Issues:

	Neither ETH code nor new code works with just Ncycle_SY flag for ncycle.

CLEAN-UP 2021/04 by Pierre Damien:

The default bgc code (BIOLOGY_BEC2) uses 26 tracers
Ncycle_SY adds 3 tracers : NO2, N2O and N2
BEC_COCCO adds a fourth autotrophic compartment : Coccolithophores (developed at ETH but never been tested at UCLA)

Overall cleaning of the bgc code : 
 - CCHEM_MOCSY and CHEM_TO_DEPTH deleted 
 - BIOLOGY_NPZDOC deleted
 - FE_SED_FLUX deleted 
 - BIOPAR_NAMELIST deleted
 - VARIABLE_ANN_ATM_PCO2 deleted
 - N2O_TRACER_DECOMP dleted
 - N2O_NEV deleted
 - USE_EXPLICIT_VSINK deleted

Gas exchanges
 - When BULK_FRC activated, the wind speed is not computed with a "reverse" bulk formulation from the wind stress 
   but directly read form the forcing

Daily average photosynthetically available radiation   
 - DAILYPAR_BEC              : daily average PAR used for BGC 
 - DAILYPAR_PHOTOINHIBITION  : daily average value used only for the evaluation of photoinhibited  nitrification
The daily average PAR needs to be read in the forcing file with the following names : 'swrad_davg' and 'srf_davg_time'


NOT RELATED WITH BEC : 

Two issues when restart from a restart file generated by the old ETH code : 
  1 : ocean time name :
      - init_scalars.F : vname(1,indxTime)='ocean_time' ->   vname(1,indxTime)='time'
      - wrt_avg.f      : ierr=nf90_inq_varid(ncavg, 'ocean_time', var_id_tmp) -> ierr=nf90_inq_varid(ncavg, 'time', var_id_tmp)
  2 : FIRST_TIME_STEP : 
      - read_write.F   : if (FIRST_TIME_STEP) then ! -> if (var_times(it1) < -90.0) then
