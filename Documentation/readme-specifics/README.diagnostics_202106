Online diagnostics - 2021/06

Diagnostics are calculated using the diagnostics module of src/diagnostics.F.
To use diagnostics you need the CPPFLAG 'DIAGNOSTICS', you then need to edit the
user input section at the top of diagnostics.F and then compile ROMS.
Select the tracer variables for which you want diagnostics in tracers_defs.h in
wrt_t_diag logical array.
See the top of diagnostics.F for a more detailed description of the available diagnostics.
