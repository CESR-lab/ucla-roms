There is an error in my step2D_FB.F which has been for there for 10+ years,
which affects all versions of my code since 2003 and all versions of AGRIF
since 2007.


The error is in setting time index "kold" at about line 84 my code (75 in the
newest version) and at about line 126 in file step2d.F from AGRIF code, search
for "kold=".

Currently the code is
        .......
      else
        kbak=kstp-1
        if (kbak.lt.1) kbak=4
        kold=kstp-2
        if (kold.lt.1) kold=4

This logic leads to a wrong value of kold=4 instead of 3 when kstp=1, which
happens once in every 4 barotropic steps.

The correct version should be
        .......
      else
        kbak=kstp-1
        if (kbak.lt.1) kbak=4
        kold=kbak-1
        if (kold.lt.1) kold=4

where only one line changed:       kold=kstp-2  --> kold=kbak-1

The consequences of this error are not severe (this is why it was never
noticed for very long time at the first place), because effectively it merges
"kold" with "kbak" r.h.s. terms once in every 4 time steps (when kstp=1, hence
kbak=kold=4) making it an AB2-AM3 (abet with non-standard, but still sane
coefficients, resulting in overall stable algorithm) stepping instead of the
intended AB3-AM4 with modified coefficients.

You would not notice any difference in practice -- the stability limit for
the barotropic mode 0.87 remains unchanged for all 3D configurations (i.e.,
when barotropic time step is very small for Coriolis and advection terms to
play any role in setting the limit). I got a slightly improved stability
limit for 384x128 soliton problem: dt_max=0.055 --> dt_max=0.061 (which is
explainable by the fact that handling advection terms is responsible for
about 25% of the stability limit.

But in any case it is obviously not what was intended and should be corrected.
