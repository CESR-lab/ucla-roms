Additional instructions for ROMS to compile on Pacific cluster at TAU.

1) Copy the bashrc file stored on the repo as your new .bashrc (save your old one somewhere). 
   Edit the line for your ROMS_ROOT. (don't forget to 'source ~/.bashrc' afterwards):
   Documentation/machine-specific/bashrc-cshrc-files/bashrc-pacific-tau-202202

2) Edit NHMG/src/Makefile - uncomment line: FC = mpiifort.

3) Uncomment the two mpiifort lines in src/Makedefs.inc.

4) Follow all the usual compile steps in the readme's.


NCJOIN_MPI:

   This works, but needs to be called with mpirun not mpiexec (not sure why). E.g:
   
   mpirun -n 4 ncjoin_mpi 2 2 sample_his.00000.*.nc
