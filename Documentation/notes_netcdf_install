These are instructions to download the intel fortran compiler with mpi and to download
and compile dedicated netcdf libraries.
This process may be tricky. You'll need many supporting libraries to be present. For instance,
the current hdf5 library requires glibc to be version 2.28 or newer. You may have to update your
system. There are also mentions of library that you may need to install during the process. These
came up for us. You might have other missing libraries. The install.log file should give you information
on what's missing.

Good luck!

Step 0: Install intel oneapi and add the setting of path names to the root .bashrc

# Go to intel download website and follow instructions. If using ubuntu, the apt instructions
are recommended.

https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/hpc-toolkit-download.html

Install the Intel oneAPI HPC Toolkit, the intel fortran essentials are not sufficient


#Add this line to /root/.bashrc and source the bashrc to activate:
. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh

# Set for compilation of netcdf-fortran library
export NETCDFC_ROOT=/opt/netcdf-c-4.9.2
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${NETCDFC_ROOT}/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


Step 1: Install the hdf library with the right compilers and the parallel option

# Download hdf tarball from hdfgroup.org: https://www.hdfgroup.org/download-hdf5/source-code/
# Change version number into the actual version for the library, currently 1.14.6

> sudo su
> cd ~
> mv <path-to-tarbal>/hdf5-1.14.6.tar.gz .  (move gzipped tarbal to /root)
> gunzip hdf5-1.14.6.tar.gz
> tar xvf hdf5-1.14.6.tar
> cd hdf5-1.14.6/

# Install zlib if you haven't installed yet
> apt install zlib1g-dev

> ./configure --prefix=/opt/hdf5-1.14.6 --enable-fortran --enable-shared --enable-parallel --with-pic CC=mpiicx FC=mpiifx CXX=mpiicpc CFLAGS="-fPIC -O3 -xHost -align" FFLAGS="-fPIC -O3 -xHost -align" CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -O3 -xHost -ip -align" FFLAGS="-I/opt/intel/oneapi/mpi/latest/include/mpi -L/opt/intel/oneapi/mpi/latest/lib"
> make -j8
> make install


Step 2: Download and install the netcdf c library, again with the right compiler and options

#Change versions into the actual versions, currently 1.14.6 for hdf, and 4.9.3 for netcdf-c

> wget https://downloads.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-c/4.9.3/netcdf-c-4.9.3.tar.gz .

# Install libxml2 if you haven't installed yet
> apt install libxml2-dev

# Install curl if you haven't installed yet
> apt install libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev


> ./configure --prefix=/opt/netcdf-c-4.9.2 CC=mpiicx CFLAGS="-O3 -align" CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/hdf5-1.14.4-2/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/hdf5-1.14.4-2/lib
> make check -j8
> make install



Step 3: Install the netcdf fortran library, again with the right compiler and options

# Change versions into the actual versions, currently 4.6.1 netcdf fortran, and 4.9.2 for netcdf-c

> wget https://downloads.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-fortran/4.6.2/netcdf-fortran-4.6.2.tar.gz
> gunzip netcdf-fortran-4.6.2.tar.gz
> tar xvf netcdf-fortran-4.6.2.tar
> cd netcdf-fortran-4.6.2

> ./configure --prefix=/opt/netcdf-fortran-4.6.1 CC=mpiicx FC=mpiifx FFLAGS="-O3 -xHost" CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/netcdf-c-4.9.2/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/netcdf-c-4.9.2/lib
> make check -j8
> make install
