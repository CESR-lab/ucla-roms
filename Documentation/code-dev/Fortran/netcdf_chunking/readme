Purpose:

Test for improvement in runtime by using chunking to delineate partition indices
which seperate subdomains. Done for only the y dimension - in the essence of 
simplicity - where grids are broken into rows whose lengths (ny) are multiples of 
the chunking size in the y dimension. 

What is measured is the time taken to write to a file, in parallel, five times over.
The reason for a loop is to produce a measurable level of runtime, in the case one
iteration would be too quick for reasonable comparison of two methods. 

Usage:

  --> make  (if not done so already)

  --> ./do_test.sh 'file' 'option'
     * number of processors used in parallel may be adjusted within ./do_test.sh
     * 'file' should be a large grid with temperature - pachug_rst.nc if available
     * 'option' may either be row (default partitioning) or chunk (new)
