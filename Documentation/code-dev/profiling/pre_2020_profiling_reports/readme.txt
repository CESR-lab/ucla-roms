The pdf in this directory: ROMS_perfomance_scaling_Comet_Xsede_pre_2020.pdf was given to me by Jim.
Although it is dated October 2020, I think that was just to supplement a recent Xsede proposal, and
the actual tests were conducted several years before. A possible indicator of the date it was performed
is from the quoted ifort compiler, which was a 2016 version.

The comet hardware was operational from 2016-2021.
