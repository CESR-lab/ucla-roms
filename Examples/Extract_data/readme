Example to show creation of ROMS online extracted files for 2 child grids and 2 moorings.

For simplicity in this example both child grids are actually identical, but in proper use you would use
child grids in different locations within the parent grid.

Output partition files can be joined using the tool: Tools-Roms/extract_data_join

For further instructions on the pre-processing to setup the input file:
