This simulation is designed to check that read_write.F (specifically find_new_record) handles start up between input files.
As well as find correct next step in new file. 
Hence, wind file is split up across multiple time records.

Simulations should start between record 2 of sample_wnd_12.nc and record 1 of sample_wnd_33.nc.
Around step 80 it should read in record 2 of sample_wnd_34.nc.
