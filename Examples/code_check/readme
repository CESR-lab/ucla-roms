Scripts to confirm simulation results still match benchmark results,
and that netcdf outputting works for his, avg and rst files.
This should ensure bugs have not been added to the code.

The script can be run directly on Maya with ./test_roms.sh
Obsolete: but needs to be run on 'comet' using the job submission: qsub run_tests_comet.lsf,
which needs to be edit to your comet user name.

Script requires a benchmark to have already been run and saved 
e.g. 'sample_wec_bm.log' is the terminal output from the
sample_wec example.
Since numerical precision can differ based on different compiler versions,
the results on maya do not exactly match the results on comet. Since the
majority of code development is done on maya (no waiting) and not comet,
the log files for maya are the default setup for this script.
Should you wish to test on comet, simply edit test_roms.py to point to
the comet benchmark log files not the maya ones. E.g:
filename_BM  = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),'benchmarks/river/river_ana_bm.log')
becomes:
filename_BM  = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),'benchmarks/river/river_ana_bm_comet.log')

The netcdf check is not machine dependant so nothing needs to be changed.
It is a somewhat crude as it just confirms that the number of records written
is what it should be, the other tests of diagnostic values should confirm
values haven't changed in netcdf files.

WEC requires AVERAGES turned on, in order for line positions to work when reading 
the log file.
