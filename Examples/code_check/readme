Examples code checking tools:

  ./do_test_all.sh maya          (on maya)

  or

  sbatch do_test_expanse_all.sh  (on expanse)


ERROR:
To improve result reproducibility, -fp-model strict is used. 
This is different from the normal example compiler option.
Therefore if the example has been previously compiled as an example not a code_check, it will not
do a full recompile on its own and the result may thus be different.

Therefore, in Examples/ use the command 'make code_check_clean' and then run the code checking script again.
This will do a full recompile of all examples with the -fp-model strict flag.


INFO:

This will check all the examples automatically.
Since it takes ~30s for ROMS to compile, the script will take several minutes
if compiling for the first time.

Every example contains its own code_check folder, with symbolic links to the files contained
in Examples/code_check.

The python script test_roms.py is used to sum all the terminal diagnostics from the ROMS
simulation.
This is compared with a previously run benchmark example, to confirm values have not changed.

This tool is designed to be run before any new commit of the repo, to ensure nothing has been
inadvertently broken.


UPDATING BENCHMARKS:

If values have been intentionally changed, then the effected examples must have their benchmark
file updated.
Make sure you have run the code check script so that test_old.log files are current.
Run the update_benchmarks.sh script to update benchmark files for your machine.
Check all is in order by running the code checking do_test_all.sh script again.
You then repeat those steps on the other machine maya or Expanse.

Commit the new benchmark files.
