Work is not stored on repo so better to use.

If you want to modify one of the examples for your own project,
copy the contents of an example directory into ../Work/.
After that cd to ../Work and modify the files specific to your
project in that directory

Available examples:

TANK - A analytical test case for the Non-hydrostatic kernel. 
       A sloshing solution in a tank.
