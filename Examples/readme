You can try any of these examples:

1) Open the specific example
2) Type 'make' to compile example.
3) Type do_roms.sh to run example.
(Note, do not edit the example)

If you want to use one of the examples for your own project, or edit
the .in file of the example:

1) copy the contents of an example directory into ../Work/ (except
for the Makefile!).
2) cd to Work/
3) Type 'make' to compile example.
4) Type do_roms.sh to run example. 

Available examples:

Bulk-frc:
  Full pacific model - 2020/11. (Won't run, needs input files)

Flux_frc:
  Sample example of flux force in flux_frc module. 2020/11.

Fortran:
  Basic tests of fortran performance, e.g. loop order/length.
  The code is idealised, not roms code. 2020/10.
  
init_arrays:
  This has init_arrays.F with no 'first touch', i.e. arrays
  are not initiliazed to zero.
  
lmd_kpp_old:
  Has lmd_kkp.F but using version pre-2020. It can give different
  results, and hence is here for comparison.
  
Pipes (ana/real):
  Analytical and realistic pipe examples. 2020/12
  
Rivers (ana/real):
  Analytical and realistic river examples. 2020/11
  
Tracers_passive:
  Realistic test of 2 passive tracers to confirm new tracer module. 2020/10.
  
USWC_model:
  This is the 'sample' domain for most realistic cases. Location near Santa Barbara.
  
WEC (ana/real):
  Analytical (1D flume) and realistic wave effect on current examples.    

TANK: 
  An analytical test case for the Non-hydrostatic kernel. 
  A sloshing solution in a tank.
