trace1 is just a tracers released at the boundary.
isalt2 is just reproducing the salinity tracer as an additional passive tracer.

tracers.F_orig is there to show how it worked originally, but src/tracers.F will be used when you
compile. However, tracers_defs.h and tracers_defs_indx.h will use what's in this directory.
