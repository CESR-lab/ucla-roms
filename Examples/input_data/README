In order to reduce the size of the repo, the input and forcing data
that are needed to run the examples are stored separately at:

https://ucla.box.com/s/tu6must5svcz8e5ebvgwc7t5dgjeq9bt

- Place all the netcdf files from the ucla box storage above to this directory.

- Partition all netcdf files using: 'partit 3 2 *.nc'. In order to do this, you 
  need to have compiled the tools in the Tools-Roms directory
