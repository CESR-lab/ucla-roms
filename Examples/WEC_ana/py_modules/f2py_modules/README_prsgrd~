COMPUTATION OF THE PRESSURE GRADIENT USING F2PY IN PYTHON
=========================================================

STEPS:
1) calculated density using rho_eos_V2
2) calculate Hz,dn_u,dm_v in python
3) call prsgrd() with all inputs



IF SPLIT_EOS is defined:
    Density needs to be calculated first using rho_eos_V2

    rho_eos_V2 will return: rho,rho1,qp1,qp2

Also, need to input some grid-specific variables for prsgrd() function
To maintain the nativeness of the ROMS code and for debugging purposes
compute these 3 variables in python before calling the prsgrd() function

	 Hz --> depths between z_w levels
	 dn_u --> dn_u(i,j)=2./(pn(i,j)+pn(i-1,j))
	 dm_v --> dm_v(i,j)=2./(pm(i,j)+pm(i,j-1))
