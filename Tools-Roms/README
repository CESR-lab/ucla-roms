This directory contains a set to basic tool to manipulate Fortran
source codes and, in principle, other text files.

! Dependecy list: Make.depend
! ===========================

 cross_matrix - analyses dependencies of Fortran source files to track 
                down CPP #include, F77-style include, and Fortran 90
                modules to guarantee the correct order of compilation
                of the cross-dependent source code files, even when
                using multiple CPUs to compile (via "make -j N" command);

! NETCDF tools
! ============

 partit -	Separates single input files over domain into multiple input
 		files based on the MPI tiling based on the parameters you set
 		in param.h file.

 ncjoin -	Joins partitioned netcdf result files (.nc) into one file
 		for better viewing of results:
 		E.g.: with files result.0.nc result.1.nc
 		ncjoin -d result.*
 		Will prodcue result.nc file containing joined results.
 		the -d flag will delete the individual files, e.g. .0. and .1.                
 
! Code editing
! ============ 

 chkindent -    checks identing and alignment of CPP #directives; 

 mreplace -  	searches and renames objects in Fortran source codes.
              	Useful for speed editing multiple files if consistent name
              	changes are required simultaneously in many places in many
              	files.  Also known to be useful for speed editing labels in
              	LaTeX files where it is non-practical or too cumbersome to
              	do it manually by standard editing tools.


All the above are compile-once-use-forever, stand-alone, self-explanatory
programs -- just execute each of them without any arguments to see what
they are and for instructions how to use them.


To compile: Simply type "make" then "make install". The executables
will be moved to ~/bin directory. The directory must pre-exist and
should be included in $PATH in ~/.cshrc or ~/.bashrc files.  
The installation path can be changed by editing Makefile. 
The compiler can be selected by chosing an appropriate Makedes.XXX file.  
There is no need for any external library beside the standard intrinsic functions.
