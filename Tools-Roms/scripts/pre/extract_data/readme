2022/04: extract_data module input file generation

Edit and run bry_extract_obj.m and/or mooring_extract_obj.m to generate input file.

Only 1 input file is read in by roms extract_data module.

To add multiple grids/moorings, rerun bry_extract_obj.m/mooring_extract_obj.m as required.
This will append additional grids/moorings to the same input file.
