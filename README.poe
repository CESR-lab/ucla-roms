The Parallel Operating Environment is used for running MPI programs.
Instead of using mpirun to run MPI programs, use the poe command.
List the poe options after the program options and any file
redirections. For example, to run a program on 4 processors:

   poe a.out < myin > myout -procs 4

See "poe -h" for the short help. There are many environment variables
and options that can be used with poe. When debugging MPI programs,
consider using the following poe options:

-infolevel 1
    poe displays errors and warnings 
-labelio yes
    output from the parallel tasks is labeled by task ID 
-euidevelop yes
    the message passing interface performs more detailed checking
    during execution. This additional checking is intended for
    developing applications and can significantly slow performance. 

Here is an example of the poe command with various debug options:

% poe allall 100 100 2000 -procs 2 -labelio yes -infolevel 1 -euidevelop yes
   0:Node 0 Complete...
   0:Host Cu12 to Host Cu12(1): 1642.407474MB/sec
   1:Node 1 Complete...
   1:Host Cu12 to Host Cu12(0): 1623.271113MB/sec
