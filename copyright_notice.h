  This code, hereafter known as Regional Ocean Modeling System
(ROMS), was developed as the result of cooperation between Institute
of Marine and Coastal Sciences in Rutgers University and Institute
of Geophysics and Planetary Physics in University of California,
Los Angeles.

 This model shall be viewed as a derivative and successor of SCRUM
family codes (originally introduced by T. Sonh, D. Haidvogel, 1994),
which was redesigned to converted into parallel code designed and
optimized to run on cache based shared memory machines.
 
  Although the present strategy for parallel ocean model does not
follow exactly any previously existent parallel code, and therefore
constitutes an oridinal approach, its development was influenced by
the experience of Joe Habermann and John Anderson from LCSE,
University of Minnessota, as well as by the experience of development
of SCMICOM ocean model code by Aaron Sawdey and Mattew O''Keefe.
 
  As this code undergoes significant mathematical changes, which
makes it substantially diffrerent from the previously known codes
SPEM and SCRUM family, it cannot be viewed as just a parallel version
of its prototype, but rather shall be viewed as a new ocean model.
 
  Although many of mathematical and algorithmic methods implemented
in this model are original, this copyright notice does not
automatically imply that all algorithm in this are original from
scratch. Neither this copyright notice restricts any contributions
of any ideas from the third parties into this model (sources of which
are normally asknowledged on the case-by-case basis).
 
 This code is released for unlimited use for the purpose of
non-commersial research.
