## Overview
	
The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) is a free-surface, terrain following, primitive equation ocean model, developed by our collaborators at UCLA. UCLA-ROMS is highly optimized, supports state-of-the-art biogeochemical modelling, and is well-suited for nested regional modelling from ocean basins down to estuaries.

This fork aims to expand support for marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) research while adhering to community driven open-source practices.

## Installing and running

Detailed instructions on installing and running ROMS can be found in our [documentation](https://cworthy-ucla-roms.readthedocs.io).
